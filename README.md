## Background
Use cases like search, recommendation, and personalization require selecting data from large corpora, running machine-learned models, and returning results in under 100 milliseconds, all while the data evolves in real-time.

This becomes especially challenging with massive datasets distributed across multiple nodes, which need to be processed in parallel without compromising speed or accuracy. Umio addresses this by offering a highly scalable and efficient platform that ensures high availability and performance even in the face of dynamic, continuously changing data.

Focused on crafting the future of AI, Umio specializes in advanced on-chain 3D agents and immersive 3D worlds, enabling next-level interactive experiences. Whether powering personalized recommendations, real-time search, or intelligent agents, Umio is already driving innovation in high-traffic services and apps, handling hundreds of thousands of queries per second and delivering seamless, low-latency results at scale..

## Install
Deploy your Umio applications to the cloud service: Umio Website , or run your own Umio instance: Umio Docs
