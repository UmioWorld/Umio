Background
Use cases like search, recommendation, and personalization require selecting data from large corpora, running machine-learned models, and returning results in under 100 milliseconds, all while the data evolves.

This is challenging with large datasets spread across multiple nodes. Umio solves this by offering high availability and performance. Focused on crafting the future of AI with advanced on-chain 3D agents and immersive 3D worlds, Umio is already powering high-traffic services and apps, serving hundreds of thousands of queries per second.

Install
Deploy your Umio applications to the cloud service: Umio Website , or run your own Umio instance: Umio Docs

Usage
The application created in the getting started guides linked above is fully functional and production-ready, though you might want to add extra nodes for redundancy.
See developing applications for adding your own Java components to your Umio application.
Umio APIs are helpful for understanding how to interface with Umio.
Explore the sample applications.
Follow the Umio Blog for feature updates and use cases.
Full documentation is available at Umio Docs.
